    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A sweet, clear, semisolid spread or preserve made from fruit juice and sugar boiled to a thick consistency, useful for making <a href="../pbnj.html">PB & J's</a>.</p>
    
    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups fruit juice (grape, apple, or berry juice works well)</li>
        <li>1 box of powdered fruit pectin (about 1.75 ounces)</li>
        <li>5 to 7 cups of granulated sugar, depending on the fruit's sweetness</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp butter or margarine (optional, to reduce foaming) </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Combine juice and pectin: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, whisk the powdered pectin into the fruit juice until it dissolves. Add the optional butter to help reduce foaming.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil: Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. A rolling boil is one that continues bubbling even when stirred.</li>
        <li>Add sugar: Stir in all of the sugar at once until it dissolves completely.</li>
        <li>Boil again: Return the mixture to a full rolling boil for exactly one minute, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Remove and skim: Remove the pot from the heat and quickly skim any foam from the top using a metal spoon.</li>
     </ol>
